        <h1>About Seismology</h1>
        <p>Seismology is the scientific study of earthquakes and the propagation of elastic waves through the Earth or through other planet-like bodies. A seismologist is a scientist who studies earthquakes and the structure of the Earth.</p>

        <h2>What is Seismology?</h2>
        <p>Seismology is a branch of geophysics that deals with the study of earthquakes, seismic waves, and the internal structure of the Earth. Seismologists use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to image the Earth's interior, similar to how a doctor uses X-rays to image the human body.</p>

        <h2>Types of Seismic Waves</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>P-Waves (Primary Waves)</strong>: P-waves are compressional waves that travel through the Earth's crust, mantle, and core. They are the fastest type of seismic wave and can travel through solid, liquid, and gaseous materials.</li>
            <li><strong>S-Waves (Shear Waves)</strong>: S-waves are shear waves that travel through the Earth's crust and mantle. They can only travel through solid materials and are slower than P-waves.</li>
            <li><strong>Surface Waves</strong>: Surface waves are seismic waves that travel along the Earth's surface. They are the slowest type of seismic wave and are responsible for the shaking felt during an earthquake.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Seismology Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Earthquake Hazard Assessment</strong>: Seismologists use seismic data to assess the likelihood of future earthquakes and their potential impact on communities.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil and Gas Exploration</strong>: Seismologists use seismic waves to image the subsurface structure of the Earth, which helps in the exploration of oil and gas reservoirs.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Monitoring</strong>: Seismologists use seismic data to monitor volcanic activity, landslides, and other environmental hazards.</li>
        </ul>
