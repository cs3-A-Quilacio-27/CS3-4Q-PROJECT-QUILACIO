      <h2>What is Seismology?</h2>
      <p>Seismology is the study of earthquakes and the forces that cause them. Earthquakes occur when the stress within the Earth's crust exceeds a certain threshold, causing the Earth's crust to rupture and release energy. This energy is released as seismic waves, which can be measured by seismometers.</p>

      <h2>How do Earthquakes Happen?</h2>
      <p>Earthquakes happen when there is a sudden release of energy stored within the Earth's crust. This can occur for various reasons, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Subduction zones: As one tectonic plate is forced under another, friction can build up between the two plates. This friction can be released suddenly as the plates move past each other, causing an earthquake.</li>
        <li>Normal faults: As one part of the Earth's crust is compressed while another part is being stretched, friction can build up between the two areas. If the pressure becomes too great, an earthquake can occur.</li>
        <li>Hotspots: Areas of the Earth's crust where magma is rising to the surface. As the magma cools and contracts, it can cause the surrounding rock to crack, causing an earthquake.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How can we Prepare for Earthquakes?</h2>
      <p>There are several steps that can be taken to prepare for earthquakes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Know the risk: By understanding the potential risk of earthquakes in your area, you can make informed decisions about where to live and work, and how to build structures to withstand earthquakes.</li>
        <li>Make your home earthquake-proof: This can involve installing straps and braces on your furniture, ensuring your walls are well-anchored, and securing any large objects that could be damaged in an earthquake.</li>
        <li>Stay informed: Regularly check the news for any potential earthquake hazards in your area, and consider subscribing to earthquake warning systems to receive alerts before an earthquake strikes.</li>
